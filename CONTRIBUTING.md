## Getting Started

To contribute to this project, it is recommended that you follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Run the unit tests on your system (see Testing section). At this point,
   if any tests fail, do not begin development. Try to investigate these
   failures. If you're unable to do so, report an issue through our
   [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/ni/nisystemlink-clients-python/issues).
3. Write new tests that demonstrate your bug or feature. Ensure that these
   new tests fail.
4. Make your change.
5. Run all the unit tests again (which include the tests you just added),
   and confirm that they all pass.
6. Send a GitHub Pull Request to the main repository's master branch. GitHub
   Pull Requests are the expected method of code collaboration on this project.

## Testing

Before running any tests, you must have a supported version of Python (3.8+) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) installed locally.

It is also helpful to install SystemLink Server and configure the NI Web Server
to run on localhost.

To install all development dependencies required:

```
poetry install
```

To run commands and scripts, spawn a shell within the virtual environment managed by Poetry:

```sh
poetry shell
# Alternatively, you can prefix commands with "poetry run"
poetry run pytest
```

There are a handful of helpful tasks in the `[tool.poe.tasks]` section of the `pyproject.toml` file. These can be run using [Poe](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet) like so:

```
poe types
```

To run all tests in place with your current python environment setup:

```
pytest
```

To only run the tests in one particular folder, run

```
pytest tests/myfolder
```

To run the SystemLink Cloud tests,
[create an API key](https://www.ni.com/documentation/en/systemlink-cloud/latest/manual/creating-an-api-key/)
and then run

```
pytest -m cloud --cloud-api-key XXXXX
```

To run the SystemLink Enterprise tests, obtain a session API key from the
[main-test](https://test.lifecyclesolutions.ni.com/) cluster and then run

```
pytest -m enterprise --enterprise-uri "https://test-api.lifecyclesolutions.ni.com" --enterprise-api-key XXXXX
```

It is important to note that depending on the terminal you are using,
you may need to escape special characters in the API key.
